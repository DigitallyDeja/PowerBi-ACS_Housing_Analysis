# PowerBi-ACS_Housing_Analysis

This project explores housing affordability trends in the U.S., focusing on **median household income, median rent, and income-to-rent gaps**. It demonstrates **data cleaning, KPI calculation, and interactive visualizations** using Power BI.  

## Datasets Used
- <a href="https://github.com/DigitallyDeja/PowerBi-ACS_Housing_Analysis/blob/main/income_percentage.csv" target="_blank">Number of Cost Burdened Households</a>

- <a href="https://github.com/DigitallyDeja/PowerBi-ACS_Housing_Analysis/blob/main/state_median_income.csv" target="_blank">Median Household Income</a>

- <a href="https://github.com/DigitallyDeja/PowerBi-ACS_Housing_Analysis/blob/main/median_gross_rent.csv" target="_blank">Median Rent</a>

## Questions KPIs 
### Summary KPI cards
- What is the national average rent price?
- What is the average median household income?
- What is the national percentage of households that are cost-burdened?

### Core KPIs 
- Which states face the heaviest financial strain when the median income is allocated towards rent
- How does the distribution of households with cost-burden levels depict the number of households that are financially affected and those that are not?
- How much of the household‚Äôs median income remains after paying annual rent?
- Are the ACS estimates according to the Margin of Error amounts?

## Process 
- Verify data for any missing data and anomalies, and transform data in Power BI
- Made sure that the data is consistent with respect to the data type, data format, and values used 
- Created charts according to the KPIs asked for and ensured that the dashboard accurately highlights this
  
## üîë Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Analysis & Cleaning**: Merged multiple ACS datasets and handled missing or inconsistent values.  
- **Power BI Visualizations**: Created column, bar, scatter, and waterfall charts to highlight key insights.  
- **Calculated Metrics & Measures**: Developed **Income-to-Rent Gap** and **MOE ratios** to quantify uncertainty.  
- **Insight Communication**: Designed visuals and KPIs that clearly convey housing cost burdens.

## Insights
- **Income-to-Rent Gap** identifies areas where households are most financially strained.  
- **MOE Ratios** (e.g., 2.15%) ensure the estimates are reliable.  
- Analysis supports **policy evaluation**, **urban planning**, and **affordability research**.
